** Hints by Daiyuu Nobori, written on March 19, 2014 **
// 
// The following 'enterprise functions' are implemented on SoftEther VPN Server
// since March 19, 2014. However, these functions are disabled on
// SoftEther VPN Servers which run in Japan and China.
// 
// - RADIUS / NT Domain user authentication
// - RSA certificate authentication
// - Deep-inspect packet logging
// - Source IP address control list
// - syslog transfer
// 
// The SoftEther VPN Project intentionally disables these functions for users
// in Japan and China. The reason is: Daiyuu Nobori, the chief author of
// SoftEther VPN, has been liable to observe the existing agreements and
// restrictions between him and some companies. The agreements have regulated
// the region-limited restriction to implement and distribute the above
// enterprise functions on the SoftEther VPN open-source program.
// 
// Therefore, the SoftEther VPN Project distributes the binary program and
// the source code with the "SiIsEnterpriseFunctionsRestrictedOnOpenSource"
// function. This function identifies whether the SoftEther VPN Server
// program is running in either Japan or China. If the restricted region is
// detected, then the above enterprise functions will be disabled.
// 
// Please note that the above restriction has been imposed only on the
// original binaries and source codes from the SoftEther VPN Project.
// Anyone, except Daiyuu Nobori, who understands and writes the C language
// program can remove this restriction at his own risk.
